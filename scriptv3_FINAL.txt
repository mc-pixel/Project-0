characters : dude, his conscience and his craziness


overview of the game : the story focuses on a man locked in quarantine, looking for his stash of tp, while slowly losing to craziness of loneliness and isolation. main character is conversing constantly with himself, his rationale and his slowly overtaking madness.


core loop: starts in the main/living room, according to house plan, character can move in between rooms only if there are doors. every room has a piece of introductory dialogue and things that could be interacted with. Player could go in and out as many time as he wants except, the new dialogue would appear upon second entrance to the same room, commenting that he already looked here and either found something and took it or he doesn't know why he is looking here and maybe his subconscious is trying to tell him something. The longer player meddles - the more craziness starts to set in, for example, if any room has been entered more that 3 times - mc would comment that he feels that he's doing something oddly repetitive and he doesn't know why and craziness would appear as a third character. After that - the more player meddles - the more craziness appears and chimes in the conversations as well as bg changes.


e.g to solve the main puzzle (acquire the roll of tp) player would need to pick up in any order:


    1 - a little spoon from the kitchen floor, covered in something sticky - LICKED IT
    2 - ice cream bucket from under blanket on his bed in room 2
    3 - find his phone in the bathroom 1
    4 - look at the tv in the living room and turn it on to see netflix
    5 - after 1,2 player would comment "I sure did hit up that stash yesterday"
    6 - after 1,2 and 4 - there would be an option in the kitchen to peek into the freezer and actually locate the tp roll there along with the note “from past you”


GOOD END: correctly located tp roll
BAD END: craziness setts in and character becomes so anxious that he hides in the bathroom and refuses to go/look anywhere else and the game breaks
